        Vuetify is a complete UI framework built on top of Vue.js. The goal of the project is 
        to provide developers with the tools they need to build rich and engaging user 
        experiences. Unlike other frameworks, Vuetify is designed from the ground up to be
        easy to learn and rewarding to master with hundreds of carefully crafted components
        from the Material Design specification
